Purpose: Return the top 50 time consuming statements aggregated by it's text.

Columns:
DB:		Database where the query ran
n_qry:		Number of Queries with same SQL text
qrytext:	First 80 Characters of the query SQL
min/max/avg:	Min/Max/Avg Execution time
total:		Total execution time of all occurences
max_query_id:	Largest query id of the query occurence
last_run:	Last day the query ran
aborted:	0 if query ran to completion, 1 if it was canceled.
alerts:		Alert events related to the query
 
Notes:
There is a commented filter of the query to filter for only Select statements (otherwise it includes all statements like insert, update, COPY)
There is a commented filter to narrow the query to a given database
